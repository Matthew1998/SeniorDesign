This file will describe the process of setting up a blank Linux machine to create a custom
inference graph for a user defined object. This will be useful because many of the online 
tutorials are incomplete or out of date. Ideally this will be comprehensive and provide all
the necessary files and instruction. FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS EXACTLY

BEFORE BEGINNING PLEASE READ THESE NOTES

1. We want to use python 3.7 as much as possible because we don't want to begin out of date


SECTION 1 - Prerequisites
1. pip3 is necessary to install this run the following lines

	sudo apt install python3-pip

2. Check the installation by running the following command.

	pip3 --version

3. If no errors have shown then you have installed pip3. This will be used to install python
   packages which will be necessary for running tensorflow.


SECTION 2 - Beginning with TensorFlow:

1. Install tensorflow by running the following command.

	pip3 install tensorflow

2. Navigate to your desired directory and clone the tensorflow github by running the following
   command.

	git clone 'https://github.com/tensorflow/models.git'

3. This will clone the github repository into a folder called 'models'. Next we want to
   install an image labelling tool called labelImg. Creative right? Run the following line
   of code to clone the repository

    git clone 'https://github.com/tzutalin/labelImg'

4. Next, install some of the requirements by first navigating into the folder created

	cd lblImg

	sudo apt-get install pyqt5-dev-tools
	sudo pip3 install -r requirements/requirements-linux-python3.txt
	make qt5py3

5. To confirm that this worked, run the following command

	python3 labelImg.py


6. Once this has been done, you are ready to begin creating your tensorflow model.
   To keep things from getting confusing this tutorial will be using the following
   directory structure.

    /home -- This is the directory that you chose to start in. It can be anything, but for the
    		 sake of this tutorial, we're going to pretend that we cloned into the directory as
    		 shown. Taking note of this will be important, and any time that it is relevant will
    		 be taken note of

    /home/models     -- This is the directory into which we just cloned the tensorflow repository

    /home/data	     -- This is the directory in which we will store any *.xml and *.record files

    /home/data/train -- This is the directory in which we will store the *.xml files which will be
    					used to train the model

    /home/data/test  -- This is the directory in which we will store the *.xml files which will be 
    					used to test the model while it is training.

    /home/images     -- This is the directory in which we will store the images that will be used 
    			        for training and testing our model

    /home/training   -- This is the directory in which we will store the final trained model

    /home/labelImg   -- This is the directory in which the image labelling tool will be stored. This
    				    tool will be used to create the *.xml files


SECTION 3 - Creating the *.xml files

1. First acquire all of the images you wish to use for training and testing. Convert these images
   into *.jpeg files and then store them in the /images directory.

2. Navigate to the /labelImg directory and run labelImg.py by using the following command

	python3 labelImg.py

3. Next, open the image directory by pressing 'Open Directory' on the GUI

4. Change the save directory to /home/data/train by clicking on 'Change Save Dir' 

5. Next, check the box which says 'Use default label' and enter the desired label.

6. Add labels by either clicking on 'Create Rectbox' or by pressing 'e' then 'w' on the keyboard

7. Label the desired object in the image by clicking and dragging. The box should highlight the entirety
   of the desired object

8. Once all of the objects are highlighted click 'Save' to save the image

9. Repeat steps 6-8 on each image you wish to be used to train the model

10. Next, change the save directory to /home/data/test by clicking on 'Change Save Dir'

11. Repeat steps 6-8 on each image you wish to be used to test the model

*** NOTE *** USE THE VAST MAJORITY OF PICTURES TO TEST THE MODEL (~ 90%)


SECTION 4 - Creating the *.record files
