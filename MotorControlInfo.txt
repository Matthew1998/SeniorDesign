This file will contain information on controlling the stepper motors

Useful commands:

G0 X## Y## Z##

    The motors will linearly move to the absolute location where the ## represent the 
    location that you're trying to move to

G1 F###

    This command controls the feed rate where ### is a number describing the speed

G28

    This command returns to the 'home' position. It interacts with limit switches and
    we aren't exactly sure/we haven't messed with it much

G92 X0 Y0 Z0

    This says to the controller that the current location of the stepper motors is now
    reset to X0 Y0 Z0. This does not change the 'home' position however!

G91

    This command enables relative mode. So each movement command is no longer correlated
    to an absolute location, rather each G0 command is an offset. This will probably be
    the preferred mode for our project.

G90
    This command enables absolute positioning mode. So a G0 command goes to the position
    described in the command rather than an offset.

M114
    This will output the current location. We haven't gotten it to work, just get error20
